		        <p>Vaccination does slow the spread of new infections. There is a significant difference in COVID prevalence between the states with lowest and highest vaccination rates. These numbers are measured from July 1st, 2021 to the present. This is the start of the summer surge, COVID rates were low and vaccines were deployed in significant numbers.</p> 
				<p>The States with lowest vaccinations had a COVID prevalence of <strong>9652</strong> cases per 100k compared to <strong>6696</strong> cases per 100k. This is a <strong>30.6%</strong> reduction in COVID cases.</p>

		        <p>Relative vaccine uptake shows high initial vaccination rates across most states followed by a lower linear rate. This indicates relatively low but steady vaccination rates will continue. Policies that promote vaccination must be pursued.  </p>

		        <p>Each band represents the relative rates of COVID transmission. In January 2021, the bands are of roughly equal size. This indicates a generally equal distribution of COVID throughout the country. This was the tail end of a major COVID surge. These bands remain roughly similar till July 2021. Overall COVID rates were low and vaccination rates were climbing strongly. In response, mask mandates eased across the country just as the more virulent Delta variant became dominant. These factors combined with slowing vaccination rates lead to another COVID surge.</p>
		        <p>After July 2021, there is quite a difference in COVID rates between the highest and lowest vaccinated states.</p>

	<h3>Results</h3>


	<p>This is a high level (statewide) overview of vaccine efficacy. Vaccines save lives and protect the public health.</p>

	<h3>Further Action</h3>  

	<p>Follow-up studies should include outcomes for hospitalization rates. Statewide analysis may be overly broad since county vaccination rates may vary greatly throughout a state. Further studies should group counties together by vaccination rates and the outcomes should be measured.</p>
